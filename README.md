# IoT-assisted-cost-effective-automated-Health-Monitoring-System
This project is a body measurement and health monitoring system using Arduino, sensors, and an LCD display with ThingSpeak IoT integration. It measures a userâ€™s height, weight, and calculates BMI (Body Mass Index), then evaluates the weight status against gender-specific healthy ranges stored in a predefined database.
